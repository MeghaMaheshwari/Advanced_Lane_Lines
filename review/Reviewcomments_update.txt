1) Incorporated review comments for the feedback part for problems faced
2) I tried using the mechanism to average data over previous frames and saw that the results obtained were poorer compared to the results I got without using te data
   of previous frames to calcuate the left and right points. Hence, I continued to stick to my orginal approach.
3) The images shown in the review feedback do not seem to be from the video generated by my code as I dumped all frames of the video into images and saw that there is no 
   such problem where the lane is not getting detected correctly.
